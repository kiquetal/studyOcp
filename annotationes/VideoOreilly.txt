Learning Path: Mastering JAVA.

A DAO is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type
of databse or persistence mechanism, providing some specific operations
without exposing details of the database.It provides a mapping from
applications calls to the persistance layer.

A FactoryMethod pattern is a way to encapsulate object creation.
The constructors are marked private, so they cannot be called except
from inside the class, and the FactoryMethod is marked as static, so that
it can be called without first having object.

Examples:

-DriverManager.getConnection()
-Connection.createStatement()
-Statement.executeQuery();
