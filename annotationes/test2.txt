POOL returns immediately with a null, if unvailable.
take returns a queued key, if no queued key is available, this method waits.

TWO STATES

-Ready indicates that the key is ready to accept events. When first created
a key is in the ready state.

Returns a path that is this path with redudant name elements eliminated.

elements.

The resulting path or this path if it does not contain redundant name elements, an empty path is returned if this path does have a root component
and all the name are redundants.

Anonymous class can never be static. Even if createad in static method.
